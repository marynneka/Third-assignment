   <h2>Programming skills</h2>
   <p>Programming skills, or coding skills, are the skills we use to write instructions for computers, 
    applications, or software. They include different programming languages and concepts.</p>
    <h3>1. Communication:</h3>
  <p>communication is an essential skill for programmers. No programmer works in isolation.
    Excellent communication skills will enable you to work effectively with others and to share ideas and solutions.
</p>
 <h3>2. Problem solving:</h3>
 <p>Problem-solving skills are extremely important for a programmer. 
    They will help you during debugging sessions and help you translate abstract requests.</p>
<h3>3. Data structures and algorithms:</h3>
<p>Software developers often know many data structures and algorithms to determine which combination 
    can help them optimize information in a program's code.</p>
    <h3>4. Testing:</h3>
    <p>Testing is the process of verifying that a software application performs 
        its intended function and meets business requirements.The ability to write tests to 
        ensure the code works as intended. 
        Debugging: Finding and fixing any bugs (errors) in the code.Many software developers 
        debug their code while writing 
        it to better ensure it's functional in the testing stage. It's important to learn how to use debugging. </p>
    <h3>5. Teamwork:</h3>
    <p>eamwork and collaboration are extremely important, 
        as while different teams within a company will work on various features or projects. </p>
        <h3>6. Database knowledge</h3>
        <p>Databases are electronic systems that allow individuals to organize and structure information, 
            particularly records for a company. Database essentials for developers include 
            familiarity with SQL and basic knowledge of insert, select, update, and delete statements.</p>
            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. 
              Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to 
              be converted into various ways of generating machine code, or, 
              in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements.</p>
                <h3>1. JavaScript:</h3>
                <p>A scripting language primarily used for web development to create dynamic content on the client side. 
                    It's also often used with server-side technologies. JavaScript is a high-level
                     programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
                     It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. 
                     JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, 
                    but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications as well.  </p>
                    <h3>2. Python:</h3>
                    <p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages today and is easy for 
                      beginners to learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming 
                      language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, 
                      user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. 
                      It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications. 
                      Python is used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk. 
                      It has also been used to create popular video games, including Civilization IV, Vegas Trike, and Toontown.</p>
<h3>3. PHP:</h3>
<p>PHP is an open-source programming language created in 1990. 
  Many web developers find it essential to learn PHP, 
  as this language is used to build more than 80% of websites on the Internet, 
  including notable sites like Facebook and Yahoo. Programmers mainly use 
  PHP mainly to write server-side scripts. But developers can also use this 
  language to write command-line scripts, and programmers with high-level PHP 
  coding skills can also use it to develop desktop applications. </p>
<h3>4. CSS:</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to 
  describe how a page that was produced in a markup language is presented. 
  A style sheet, which is a set of rules for web browsers, can control an HTML or XML. 
  CSS is used to style all HTML tags, including the body of the document, headings, 
  paragraphs, and other material. CSS can also be used to style how table components, grid elements, 
  and images are displayed. Web developers use CSS to create responsive and accessible websites.</p>
  <h3>5. HTML:</h3>
  <p>HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages and applications. 
    HTML is used to create web pages. 
    You can use HTML to add images, links, and other types of content to your web page. 
    HTML is used to structure and present content on the web 
    and is typically used alongside CSS and JavaScript</p>
<h3>6. Java:</h3>
<p>Owned by Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming 
  language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for 
  applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) 
  because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, 
  Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, 
  from mainframe data centers to smartphones. ava is widely 
  used in web and application development as well as big data. 
  Java is also used on the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. 
  It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications.</p>
